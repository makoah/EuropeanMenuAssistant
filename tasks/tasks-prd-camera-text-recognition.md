## Relevant Files

- `js/cameraManager.js` - Main camera functionality and OCR processing
- `js/cameraManager.test.js` - Unit tests for camera manager
- `js/textProcessor.js` - Text filtering, Spanish detection, and suggestion logic
- `js/textProcessor.test.js` - Unit tests for text processing
- `js/main.js` - Integration with existing search functionality (modifications)
- `styles/components.css` - Camera UI styling and responsive design (modifications)
- `index.html` - Camera icon addition to search section (modifications)

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `cameraManager.js` and `cameraManager.test.js` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- OCR processing will use Tesseract.js library which needs to be added to package.json dependencies.
